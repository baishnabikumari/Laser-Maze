## About this GAME(The Laser-Maze)
**Why to play Laser Maze?** ahh cuz it is a physics based puzzle game built with using the concept of laser, mirror and splitter reflections where you can see the real mechanism of the laser and the mirror its more like a physics experiment -- You will really enjoy the game.

> **Build using plain JavaScript, CSS and HTML5 Canvas.**

##

# Real-Time physics
**Laser calculates the path instantly as you move the mirror or splitter.**
**Now i have added two portals that is portal_in and portal_out where the portal_in(blue color) is taking the laster inside and making it all the out to the portal_out(yellow color).**
**One wrong angle and the reflection or the connection breaks.**

##

# Features
* **Real-Time Raycasting**
* **Drag & Drop system from down inventory**
* **Particle effect in laser beam**
* **Levels are made up of ASCII texttile(strings)**
* **Sound Effects**
* **LocalStorage**
* **Restart feature that is crazy af**

##

# Controls
> **Use Mouse to DRAG the mirror and place them on grids.**

> **Click the Objects(mirror or splitter) To turn on the ROTATE mode (a green outline will appear).**

> **Use Arrow after you see a green outline on the selected object to change the directions.**

##

# Playing techniques
> **See, if you are in difficult levels like 6, 19, 11, and 14, or may be any hard level so upto level 10 you can use HINT but after it you can't cuz i dont implemented that yet(will make it in future, my bad),,, so first place the splitters in the best position where the laser can be redirected in two different directions(one in left and up and 2nd is right and down) so now you are left with mirrors so place them in such way they can catch the 1 or more target once if they are not targeting one or more so you may use the 2nd splitter there to make it more easy and fun...**

> **Let's now talk about the Portal_in and Portal_out levels like 19,20 etc... --See if the laser is not passing through it so place a mirror there and make laser pass through it and then see the incoming laser coming through the portal_out(Yellow color portal) now its your turn to make the level easy and fun according to the target where they are on the grid to hit them correctly using the objects(mirror, splitters and more if there is any then).**

> **If you are seeing the para you can send me ss to by completing the level on my Slack account (DM me(@Scarlet Erza) or tag me in @milkyway) -_- waiting for responses...**

##

# How Levels are made?
> **There are now 20 levels currently... More soon.**
> **All levels are handcrafted using ASCII tiles maps**
> **The level contains the below objects**
```bash
Mirror(/, \\)
Splitter(%)
Portals(In and Out)
```
##

# Code/File structure and the working. 
> **index.html** Ui, canvas etc.

> **style.css** theme, buttons, design UI and more uses: root.

> **game.js** Logic and Physics(Mirrors, splitters and Portal_in and Portal_out).

> **2 .mp3 files(sound effects used these sound from the Pixabay)**

> **png's for new **handdrawn pen & pencil sketch** and designed on canva and made on paper by me, using pen & pencil and a many papers forgot to record for arthours but np my bad hehehe.
